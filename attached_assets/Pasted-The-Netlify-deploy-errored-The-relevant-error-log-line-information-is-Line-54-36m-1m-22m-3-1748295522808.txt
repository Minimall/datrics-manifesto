Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to a configuration error related to plugins. The error message specifies that plugins must be installed either in the Netlify App or in "package.json."

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `@netlify/plugin-auth0` package is listed in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. If the package is not included, run the following command to add it as a dev dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install -D @netlify/plugin-auth0
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn add -D @netlify/plugin-auth0
   ```

After adding the necessary plugin to the project dependencies, trigger the build again to ensure that it completes successfully.
