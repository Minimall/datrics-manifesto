Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to a missing script "build" in the npm configuration.

The relevant error lines are:
```plaintext
61: npm error Missing script: "build"
63: npm error To see a list of scripts, run:
64: npm error   npm run
```

### Solution
1. Update the `package.json` file in the repository to include a script for the build command.
2. Ensure that the `scripts` section in `package.json` includes a "build" script.
3. Verify that the "build" script is correctly defined and points to the correct Eleventy build command.
   
Make sure the package.json file in the repository has the following (or similar) script defined:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "eleventy"
}
```

After updating the `package.json` file, push the changes to the repository to trigger a new build with the correct build script configuration.
