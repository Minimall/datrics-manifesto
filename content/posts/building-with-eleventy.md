# Building Modern Websites with Eleventy

Eleventy has become one of the most popular static site generators, and for good reason. It combines **simplicity** with **powerful features** to create an exceptional developer experience.

## Why Eleventy Stands Out

Unlike other static site generators, Eleventy doesn't impose a specific framework or structure. You can use:

- **Multiple template languages**: Nunjucks, Liquid, Handlebars, and more
- **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Flexible data**: JSON, YAML, JavaScript modules, and APIs
- **Incremental builds**: Only rebuilds what changed

:::subparagraph Performance Benefits
Eleventy generates pure HTML with no client-side JavaScript by default, resulting in lightning-fast page loads and excellent SEO performance.

## Getting Started

Setting up a new Eleventy project is straightforward:

```bash
npm install @11ty/eleventy
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

Your site will be running locally in seconds, with hot reloading for instant development feedback.

## Advanced Features

Eleventy shines when you need advanced functionality:

- **Collections**: Automatically group related content
- **Filters**: Transform data within templates  
- **Shortcodes**: Create reusable components
- **Pagination**: Generate multiple pages from data

The plugin ecosystem extends Eleventy's capabilities even further, with plugins for image optimization, syntax highlighting, and much more.

## Perfect for Content Management

When paired with headless CMS solutions like Decap CMS, Eleventy becomes a powerful content management platform that's both developer and editor friendly.
