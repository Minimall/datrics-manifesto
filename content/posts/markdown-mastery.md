# Mastering Markdown for Web Content

Markdown has revolutionized how we write for the web. This lightweight markup language lets you focus on **content creation** while automatically handling formatting and structure.

## Enhanced Markdown Features

Our site supports several advanced markdown features that go beyond the basics:

### Custom Attributes

You can add CSS classes and attributes directly to elements:

```markdown
This text has a {.highlight} class applied to it.
```

This text has a {.highlight} class applied to it.

### Container Blocks

Create special sections with custom styling:

:::subparagraph Advanced Tip
Container blocks like this one help organize content and draw attention to important information without cluttering your markdown with HTML.

## Typography Excellence

Markdown handles all the essentials beautifully:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle highlighting  
- `Inline code` for technical terms

### Code Blocks

```javascript
// Syntax highlighting makes code readable
function generateStaticSite() {
    return eleventy.build();
}
```

## Lists and Structure

Markdown excels at creating well-structured content:

1. **Ordered lists** for step-by-step instructions
2. **Unordered lists** for feature highlights
3. **Nested lists** for hierarchical information

## Images and Media

Adding images is simple and semantic:

```markdown
![Alt text describing the image](/uploads/example.jpg)
```

The drag-and-drop image support in our CMS makes this even easier - just drop an image and the markdown link is automatically generated.

## Best Practices

- Keep paragraphs focused and scannable
- Use headings to create clear content hierarchy
- Leverage markdown's simplicity rather than forcing complex layouts
- Test your content in different contexts and screen sizes

Markdown's power lies in its simplicity - it gets out of your way so you can focus on creating great content!
